    <p>Hello my dear friends, I'm Frinx, I'm from Nicaragua but currently living in Guatemala, I'm 29 years old. I like Applied Technology because it would help me to develope skills to be a web developer. One of my goals is to work for Imaginary Cloud and web desing will help me to reach that goal, I just turned 11 years as a member of the church on June 9th and I work with the young men of my stake.
       I have married to a wonderful woman and now after 2 years we have a daughter, everytime I see her she reminds me how beautiful life is. I'm currently working as a customer service rep, I love drawing and painting and work out also I want to mention that soccer is my favorite sport.</p>
